# ag1000g-bakeoff

This repository defines variant calling challenges using sequence data from the [_Anopheles gambiae_ 1000 Genomes Project (Ag1000G)](https://www.malariagen.net/projects/ag1000g).

Details of challenges can be found in the `challenges` subdirectory. 
Submissions are made via a pull request to this repo in the `submissions` directory of the relevant challenge.
Example submissions are available.

Submissions will be explored and evaluated with results and analyses posted in this repository, which will be a forum for the discussion and improvement of variant calling technologies.

Feel free to open an issue with any questions.

## Summary of challenges

1. Variant calling from 22 _Anopheles gambiae_ whole genome sequences taken from an experimental cross. Data are short reads from Illumina HiSeq. Submissions evaluated based on mendelian error rates, and parsimony of inheritance.
